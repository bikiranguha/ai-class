# Tree search algorithm

	function treeSearch(initialState, goalTest):

		initialize frontier with initialState # frontier is like a place where the items to be explored next are kept

		# loop till frontier is empty
		while not frontier.isEmpty():
			state = frontier.remove()

			if goalTest(state):
				return success(state)
				# if goalTest is false, then load all neighbours of state and try again
				for neighbour in state.neighbors(): 
					frontier.add(neighbour)

		return Failure # looped through all the items and none of them passed the goal test

		Note: We can run into an infinite loop since neighbours can contain items we have already explored.
