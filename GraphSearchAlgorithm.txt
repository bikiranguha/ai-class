# Graph search algorithm

	function graphSearch(initialState, goalTest):

		# frontier is like a place where the items to be explored next are kept
		initialize frontier with initialState 

		# The explored set will contain all the nodes which have been explored
		explored = Set.new()

		Note: Due to the presence of the explored set, we do not run into infinite loops while doing a search
